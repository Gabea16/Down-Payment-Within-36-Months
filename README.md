# Down-Payment-Within-36-Months
Similar to the other Down Payment repository, the following code finds the best savings rate to afford a down payment on a million-dollar house in 36 months, given an input starting salary. The key requirement is that the guessed savings rate must result in current savings falling within a certain range of the required down payment at the end of the 36 months. This is achieved using a bisection search, where the savings rate (guess) is adjusted iteratively within two bounds (high and low). In each iteration, the program checks whether the current savings—calculated using the guessed savings rate—closely matches the required down payment. If not, the bounds are updated based on whether the savings are too high or too low, the guess is recalculated, variables are reset, and the process repeats. The loop continues until the program finds an acceptable savings rate that results in total savings within the allowed margin of error. This efficient search ensures that the required down payment can be achieved within the specified timeframe.
